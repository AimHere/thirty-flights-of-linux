Linux port by David Sinclair
------------------------------

The resulting binaries ought to work with version 24 of
Thirty Flights of Loving and version 11 of Gravity Bone,
both from Blendo Games. If they work with other versions,
then that's a nice bonus.

Various little bits of code here and there have been fiddled around
with in order to make this run on Linux. Therefore any bugs other 
inadequacies present in this code might well be my fault and not 
those of any of the previous authors, though they'll retain their
copyrights in the code, where appropriate.

And, to reiterate, this code is based on the work of:

  Quake II, by id Software (idsoftware.com)
  KMQuake II, by Knightmare (markshan.com/knightmare)
  Lazarus, by David Hyde and Mad Dog
  Thirty Flights of Loving and Gravity Bone,
  both from Brendan Chung (blendogames.com)

And uses:
  OGG Vorbis
  ZLib
  Libpng
  Libjpeg
  SDL

Known bugs:

Camera seems to jump to the side when coming from the menu

Mouse doesn't work properly in fullscreen

Loading and/or Saving doesn't work in Gravity Bone

Sporadic Crash when entering plane/Apartment in TFOL

TODO

Fullscreen and Resolution changes are pretty horrible at the moment

Find people to test this on

Cut down on indirection with the RW_IN_foo_fp files

Use the system SDL libraries, instead of bundling them
